# projects
Hello and welcome to Gilbert Rosal's project repository.

This repository contains all of Gilbert's coding projects starting from Fall 2018.

At the moment there are three projects:
    1. Stanford Scrappers - 
    This project is contained in the Stanford Scrappers folder. The folder contains the Java code for Gilbert's 106A Graphics Contest entry Stanford Scrappers, an independently developed 2-player fighting game that uses a keyboard interface to allow players to menu, read instructions and view credits, select from one of 6 maps, then fight one another. Gilbert finished this project in exactly 1 week over Thanksgiving break of 2018.
    2. Coin 
    This project is made up of the Assets, Packages, and Project Settings folders in the main repository. The game, titled Coin, is a single-player puzzle app developed using C# and Unity2D that has mirror reflections of the sprite that both move when one moves, but are faced with a different set of obstacles. The player must get both sprites to an exit at the same time. This game is in the midst of development, containing 10 levels, a self-made soundtrack, and self-made artwork. The goal for initial release is 30 levels.
